      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
I am an undergraduate of Computer Science at the University of Lagos, and my major interest revolves around creating software that is simple, clear, and well structured, as well as perfecting code through continuous editing and iteration. I take pleasure in engaging in projects that unite logic, creativity, and exactness, and I value improving existing codebases rather than merely writing new code from scratch.
</p>

<p>
My academic journey has equipped me with essential skills in mathematical reasoning, logical thinking, and problem solving. Beyond coursework, I have built through self study a strong foundation that supports practical development work as well as research projects that require patience, organization, and diligent focus.
</p>

<p>
I am expanding my skills beyond front end development into more complex technologies such as Node.js, AJAX, and Object Oriented Programming as part of my full stack training. My university education has also familiarized me with languages such as Python, Java, and C#, alongside introductory experience with Assembly concepts, all of which have influenced the way I think about systems and software design.
</p>

<p>
I am a Developer Intern at Eudog Associate, where I help in the creation of digital solutions that are efficient and user centered. This position has enabled me to develop skills in areas such as code refinement, collaboration, and the conversion of ideas into feasible implementations that are both functional and easy to maintain.
</p>

<p>
Outside the sphere of software development, I am passionately attracted to research, writing, and scientific exploration in fields such as education, medicine, and social thought. My motivation comes from inquisitiveness and a genuine desire to understand how systems work and how thoughtful design and thorough analysis can result in meaningful improvement.
